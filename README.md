# CS-6357-01-ROI-Based-Augmentations-and-SAM2

The code contains three folders, each correlating to one portion of the project. These run independently of one another. 

1. ROI-Based Augmentations
2. SAM2 Segmentation
3. Watershed Segmentation

Let me preface by saying **I cannot share the data** so you will not be able to execute this program on our dataset. That said, to run these, you'll go into the respective folder and execute the specific command.
